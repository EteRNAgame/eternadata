# Eterna Data for RNA sensors

This repository contains curated RNA-MaP (RNA on massively parallel array) datasets from the Eterna project for design of sensors that respond to RNA inputs and also report output through binding RNA. 

The data are in the form of a tab-delimited text file with over 600,000 rows.

These were the data used to develop the Ribonet software as described in the manuscript:

Further description of the experiments that produced these data are being made available in a manuscript:

Greenleaf, Rhiju Das (2023) **Rationally designed RNA sensors that compute increasingly complex functions of multiple inputs**.
